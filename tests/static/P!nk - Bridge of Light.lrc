[00:01.73]Is all you got,

[00:04.79]Blue turns black,

[00:08.42]Your confidence is cracked,

[00:11.66]There seems no turning back from here

[00:16.89]

[00:17.54]Sometimes there isn't an obvious explanation

[00:24.79]While the holiest stars can feel the strongest palpitations

[00:30.45]

[00:31.29]That's when you can build a bridge of light,

[00:35.84]That's what turns the wrong so right

[00:39.09]That's when you can't give up the fight

[00:43.68]

[00:44.83]That's when love turns nighttime into day,

[00:49.38]That's when loneliness goes away,

[00:52.35]That's when you gotta be strong tonight,

[00:58.11]Only love can build us a bridge of light

[01:04.05]

[01:05.36]On your feet, I made a storm

[01:11.49]You're convinced that you're all alone

[01:18.58]Look at the stars, it's straight up the dark

[01:24.68]You'll find your heart shines like the sun

[01:30.44]

[01:31.36]Let's not let their anger get us lost

[01:37.59]And the need to be right cause us way too high costs

[01:44.00]

[01:45.11]That's when love can build a bridge of light

[01:49.38]That's what turns the wrong so right

[01:52.73]That's when you know it's worth the fight

[01:57.83]

[01:58.48]That's when love turns nighttime into day

[02:02.57]That's when loneliness goes away,

[02:05.73]That's when you gotta be strong tonight

[02:11.40]'cause only love can build us a bridge of light

[02:17.62]

[02:25.99]Deep breath, take it on the chin

[02:31.47]But don't forget to let the love back in

[02:38.34]

[02:38.99]That's when love can build a bridge of light

[02:42.64]That's what turns the wrong so right

[02:46.01]That's when you can't give up the fight

[02:50.56]

[02:51.67]That's when love turns nighttime into day,

[02:56.60]That's when loneliness goes away

[02:59.20]That's when you gotta be strong tonight

[03:04.77]'cause only love can build us a bridge of light

[03:12.01]Only love can build us 

[03:16.42]a bridge of light...
